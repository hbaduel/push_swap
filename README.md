<h1 id="-push-swap">ðŸ“Š Push_Swap</h1>
<p>This C project was coded during my schooling at 42 Perpignan.<br>
It consists of creating a sorting algorithm in ascending order in a minimum of steps.<br>
The rules are as follows :
<li>I am limited to 2 stacks, a and b.</li><br>
<li>There is a limited number of authorized instructions:<ol>
<li>sa (swap a): Swaps the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Does nothing if there is only one or none.</li>
<li>sb (swap b): Swaps the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Does nothing if there is only one or none.</li>
<li>ss: sa and sb at the same time.</li>
<li>pa (push a): Takes the first element at the top of b and puts it on a. Does nothing if b is empty.</li>
<li>pb (push b): Takes the first element at the top of a and puts it on b. Does nothing if a is empty.</li>
<li>ra (rotate a): Shifts all the elements of stack a by one position. The first element becomes the last.</li>
<li>rb (rotate b): Shifts all the elements of stack b by one position. The first element becomes the last.</li>
<li>rr: ra and rb at the same time.</li>
<li>rra (reverse rotate a): Shifts all elements of the the battery a. The last element becomes the first.</li>
<li>rrb (reverse rotate b): Shifts all elements of the the pile b. The last element becomes the first.</li>
<li>rrr: rra and rrb at the same time.</li></ol></li>

<h2 id="-algorithm">ðŸ§® Algorithm</h2>
<p>To succeed in this project, I reproduced the radix algorithm, which consists of sorting by unit. For this I used bit shift.<br>
However, this algorithm is too slow to get more than 84 points in the project rating system. In addition, to not exceed the maximum number of moves for stacks of 5 or less, I created an algorithm that sorts the numbers situationally.</p>
